I am Tillson Galloway, a 15 year old from Charleston, SC, and a recipient of a 2014 WWDC Student Scholarship. I am just finishing my freshman year at [Porter-Gaud School] where I am an honors student working in their advanced 4-year Computer Science curriculum and work in the technology helpdesk program to help teachers with technology needs.  Because my programming skills are already beyond what the school offers for freshmen, I participate in a program at [The College of Charleston] in the Innovations Lab where I work with the top Computer Science majors as they develop real products for real clients.  I am the first high school freshman in the program.

Having participated in the WWDC14 Student Scholars program, I was fortunate to begin learning Swift from the very beginning.  Over the last year, I have worked to integrate Swift into all my programming projects, and serve as an administrator for a web group of other WWDC Student Scholarship recipients/2015 applicants to help us all share our experiences and stay connected.  I even created a website dedicated to alerting members of the group when the WWDC15 information became available by automatically checking the page every minute and sending instant SMS notifications to those who subscribed when details were posted.  It worked beautifully, as the group was notified the minute the information was available.  I love turning code into projects that help make peopleâ€™s lives easier and more productive.

Beyond my pursuits in programming, I love listening to music, hanging out with friends, learning to drive, watching Netflix, annoying my two brothers, and sleeping.  While I do spend time working on real projects for real clients, I do save time to be a typical teenager.

Fun fact: I am the great-great grandson of General George S. Patton, the greatest war General in American history.
